# Mall Customer Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** for a mall using **unsupervised machine learning**. The goal is to analyze customer spending behavior and group them into distinct segments, allowing businesses to target marketing strategies effectively.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset contains **customer demographics and spending patterns**. It typically includes:
- **Customer ID**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1-100)** (higher score means more spending)

### 🔍 Data Source
- (Mention dataset source, e.g., Kaggle’s Mall Customers dataset)

## 🏗️ Project Structure
```
├── model_train_Mallcustomer.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for training
├── data/                            # Dataset folder
│   ├── mall_customers.csv          # Dataset file
├── models/                          # Saved models

```

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mall-customer-segmentation.git
cd mall-customer-segmentation
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open `model_train_Mallcustomer.ipynb` and execute the steps.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values (if any)
- Feature scaling for numerical values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**

### **2️⃣ Clustering Algorithms Used**
- **K-Means Clustering** (Elbow Method to find optimal k)
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

### **3️⃣ Model Evaluation & Visualization**
- Silhouette Score for cluster validation
- Cluster visualization using **scatter plots & dendrograms**

## 🚀 Usage
- Run `model_train_Mallcustomer.ipynb` to perform customer segmentation.
- Analyze different clusters for business insights.
- Identify high-spending customers for targeted promotions.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Customers were grouped into **distinct clusters** based on their spending behavior.
- High-income, high-spending individuals formed a key target group.
- Young customers with high spending scores were identified as a valuable segment.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Incorporate more features like purchase history.
- Apply **Deep Learning** for more advanced segmentation.
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
